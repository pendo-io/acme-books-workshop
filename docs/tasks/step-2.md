# Step 2: Add the favorite books component to the homepage

## What is a component?
Components are reusable blocks of code that contain a specific part of the user interface, e.g. a table, a navbar, a header or footer.
This lets us break down our web page into smaller pieces that are easier to work with. A web page often consists of many components, and components may also consist of other components.</br>
We can make components in Vue ourselves, or use built-in components. 

## a) Add the book card component to the homepage
Each book stored in `/data/books.json` has a favorite field that, if true, marks that book as a favorite book. In this step you will display those favorite books on the homepage.

Note that most coding keywords are in American English, e.g. favorite, color, etc.

Open `/src/components/BookCard.vue` and have a look at it. It has three main sections: template, script and style and is an example of a custom Vue component.

The template is where you structure your component using HTML. HTML is a markup language that is used to tell your browser what and how to display your elements. Some examples of elements are: headings, buttons, and paragraphs. You can learn more about HTML on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/).

The script is where the logic goes using JavaScript. JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world and allows you to create more complex web pages where the content updates dynamically. 

Finally there is a style section where you can define the styles for your component using CSS. For example background color, text color, object size, font etc.

All three technologies work together to create dynamic web pages and apps.

## b) The BookCard component is currently not being used by the homepage. 
Follow the steps below to add it:
1. Open `src/pages/index.vue` (the homepage component).
2. Find the `<div />` that has step 2 underneath it.
3. Add the component `<book-card />` underneath the 'Step 2 ...' line. Your code should look something like this:

```
<div class="cards-container">
  <!-- Step 2: Add the <book-card/> component here. -->
  <book-card />
</div>
```

In the script section we have pre-filled a few lines of code to help show this component on your screens. Save your changes and have a look at your webpage.

### c) Adding properties to the component
For `index.vue` we already return a list of the `favoriteBooks` for the component to use in the template. Now we need to loop through the list of books to check which are favorites, using v-for (a built-in vue loop function). To do this successfully we need a unique identifier or key, e.g. isbn. We also want to display the title of the book. Add the isbn and title properties to your `<book-card />` component as follows:

```html
<book-card
  v-for="book in favoriteBooks"
  :key="book.isbn"
  :title="book.title"
/>
```
Technical explanation: The `v-for` line uses the store getter `getFavoriteBooks`, which gets all of the books from `books.json` that have `favorite: true` set. We can use `v-for` to loop through each book in the favorite books list and create a book card component for each of the favorite books. The `v-for` requires a unique key for each component, in our case the isbn.

## c) Finally we can pass data to the components props.
We need to use the following pattern when adding any data to our component: `:prop-name="value"`.
For example, we can pass the title to the component by doing `:title="books.title"`. We have to tell the component that the title comes from the books object.
