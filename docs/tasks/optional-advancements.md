# Optional advances: Add navigation, list all the books in a table, add actions for the table and the books
## a) Add navigation
Create a new vue component inside of the components folder called `Navbar.vue`. This component will be used inside of `src/layouts/default.vue` as this is the component that declares the page layout. Anything you add here will appear on every page, which is what we want for our navbar.

Use the [vuetify app bar](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/app-bars/) in `Navbar.vue` to add a navigation bar that can route between the root homepage `/` and the all books page `/all-books` (which is currently empty). Then add your navbar component to the default layout component.

## b) Add table component
In this section, we will be adding a list of all books to the `all-books.vue` layout, using a [vuetify data table](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/data-tables/basics/). Similar to the book card, component, we will add the component using kebab-case naming standard, by adding the following to the template:

```
<v-data-table ... />
```

Make sure to read through the documentation of the component to familiarise yourself with the usage, and code examples to make implementing this part easier!

Get the books data from the Pinia store:

```
import { useBookStore } from '@/stores/bookStore';

const bookStore = useBookStore();
const allBooks = bookStore.books;
```

We will need to select the column headers that we want to display, give them a title, and a key to identify the correct row in our book object. For example, if we have a book data object that is structured like:

```
      {
        "isbn": "1933988673",
        "title": "Unlocking Android",
        "pageCount": 416,
        ...
      },
```

and we wanted to choose `pageCount` as a table column, we would add this to our headers like:

```
const headers = [
  {
    title: 'Page Count' //displayed column title,
    key: 'pageCount' // book object attribute
  },
  ... //rest of the chosen headers
]
```

Now we have defined our book data and selected headers, we can add these as props to the vuetify component:

```
<v-data-table
  :items="allBooks"
  :headers="headers" />
```

## c) Add at least one of the following features to the table
### Search
Search is a common filtering method, which will only display rows that match/contain a specified search query. the vuetify data table component comes with a built `search` prop, in which you can provide some text string (usually typed into an input), and your table will be automatically filtered. See more info and an example here:
https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/data-tables/data-and-display/#search

### Pagination
Pagination is a techinique used to divide large sets of data into smaller, more manageable pages. Instead of displaying all possible rows for your data table all at once, we can break these down into discrete pages, allowing users to navigate through the rows, page by page. Vuetify data table has an`itemsPerPage` prop, to define how long each page should be, and a `v-model:page` binding to signify which number 'page' should be currently displayed. See more info, and an example with dynamic changing of pages here:
https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/data-tables/data-and-display/#pagination-examples

### Column sorting
Users may want to sort rows by a specific column value, to organise the data in either an ascending or descending order. For example, if you were to sort a table in descending order by the 'Created At' column, it would show the most recently created rows at the top, and the oldest created rows at the bottom. This functionality makes the user experience more interactive, user-freindly and efficient. See examples of column sorting here:
https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/data-tables/data-and-display/#sorting-examples

### Filtering by category
Add buttons to filter books by category

<hr style="margin-top: 32px">
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-top: 16px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">
  <span><a href="./docs/tasks/step-2.md">‚Üê Previous Step</a></span>
  <span><a href="README.md">üè† Home</a></span>
  <span><a href="./docs/tasks/step-4.md">Next Step ‚Üí</a></span>
</div>

## d) Add a checkbox component to the table
Add a checkbox to the vuetify table using the `item-value` prop
(https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/data-tables/data-and-display/#selection-examples).
The selected values should be the books marked as favorite.

The value of the selected items can be access through the `v-model` prop. The array consists of the values set using the item-value prop, so you will need to add the `return-object` prop as well. See the example: https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/data-tables/data-and-display/#selected-values.

When you check or uncheck a checkbox these selected items will change. You should use the `updateBook` action in the Pinia `bookStore` to update the books by setting and un-setting the favorites field when a book is checked and unchecked on the table.

## e) Unfavorite a book from the homepage
For each book card component in the list of favorite books on the homepage, add a button so that you can unfavorite the book. Use the `updateBook` action again and you can use a vuetify button component if you wish (https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/buttons/).

## f) Favorite a book from the homepage
Add a button to the homepage that opens a drawer or modal that allows you to favorite a book.

## g) Edit a books details
Add a way for a user to edit a books details (from the homepage and from the table). Use the `updateBook` action in the store. Include a way to remove a book from your library list using the `deleteBook` store action.

<hr style="margin-top: 32px">
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; margin-top: 16px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px">
  <span><a href="./docs/tasks/step-3.md">‚Üê Previous Step</a></span>
  <span><a href="README.md">üè† Home</a></span>
  <span></span>
