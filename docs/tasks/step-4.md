# Step 4: Style the homepage with CSS
CSS stands for [Cascading Style Sheets](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) and describes how our HTML elements should be displayed on screen. It can save a lot of work, as we can style the same kind of HTML element with one CSS reference. 

For example, imagine a webpage where we have a header (`<h1 />`), a subheading (`<h2 />`), some text (`<p />`), then another subheading (`<h2 />`) and some more text (`<p />`).

``` HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>An < h1 /> heading</h1>
        <h2>An < h2 /> heading</h2>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>
        <h2>Another < h2 /> heading</h2>
        <p>My second paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
It looks something like this:

## a) Using HTML tags
Instead of individually applying styles to each element one by one, we can style all instances of the type of element (the tag) at the same time. 

### Example using HTML tags
Based on the example above, we can style each type of element with some basic CSS. Any colors (e.g. `background-color`, `color`) can be styled in a few different ways. Don't forget everything is done in American English.
1. Color name, e.g. `gray` or `greenyellow`.
2. Hex color code, e.g. `#E2F9B8` or `#D16014`.
3. RGB, e.g. `rgb(238, 222, 240)` or `rgb(70, 3, 28)`.

Have a look over the docs linked above to find out what the next set of CSS does.

``` css
h1 {
    background-color: gray; /* uses color name */
    color: greenyellow;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif; 
    padding: 25px;
}

h2 {
    background-color: #E2F9B8; /* uses color hex code */
    color: #D16014;
    border-radius: 15px;
    text-align: center; 
    font-size: 20px; 
    max-width: 600px; 
    padding: 5px;
}

p {
    background-color: rgb(238, 222, 240); /* uses rbg code */
    color: rgb(70, 3, 28);
    font-size: small; 
    height: 200px; 
```
This set of CSS rules will be applied to our headers and paragraphs as so:

## b) Using classes and ids
As well as using HTML tags to style specific types of element, we can uses classes or ids. 

A [class](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_classes.asp) is normally something you use for multiple elements, whereas an [id](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_id.asp) is a unique name for one element.

### Example using classes and ids
Going back to our example above, let's say we wanted to group the first subheader and paragraph and then group the second subheader and paragraph, but keep the main header as its own element.

We would add the same class to each element that we want to group together to be styled the same, and an id to each element that we want to style in a specific way.</br>
You add your class or id as so:
``` HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1 id="main-header">An < h1 /> heading</h1>
        <h2 class="first-section">An < h2 /> heading</h2>
        <p class="first-section">My first paragraph.</p>
        <h2 class="second-section">Another < h2 /> heading</h2>
        <p class="second-section">My second paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
Now we can style our webpage using those ids and classes, like this:
``` css
#main-header {  /* we use the hash # symbol for ids */
 background-color: beige;
    color: brown;
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: #1F7A8C;
    border-width: 5px;
    padding: 5px;
    margin: 50px;
}

.first-section { /* we use a full stop . for classes */
    background-color: #022B3A;
    color: #E1E5F2;
    border-radius: 15px;
    text-align: center;
    max-width: 600px;5
}

.second-section {
    background-color: rgb(194, 245, 136);
    color: rgb(1, 30, 5);
    width: 400px;
}
```
This set of CSS rules will be applied to our HTML as so:

## c) Your turn!
Using the documentation links and examples provided have a go at styling the homepage.

[coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) is a great resource to help you with colors and themes.

1. Open `src/pages/index.vue`.
2. You'll notice that there are already a couple of classes defined - `home` and `cards-container` in the `<template />` section.
3. There are already some styles defined in the `<style> ... </style>` section for `home`, but `cards-container` needs some rules. Add a few rules here and reload your webpage to see how it looks!
4. Add some more classes or ids to any of the elements in the `<template />` section. 
5. Define the styles using css in the `<style> ... </style>` section.
6. Have a look at the `src/components/BookCard.vue` file and style this component however you wish!
